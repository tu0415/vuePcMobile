      <div class="title">A blockchain-based incentive community platform to share knowledge</div>
      <div class="firstTitle">Abstract</div>
      <div class="text">32 Know is a platform that focuses on spreading blockchain industry information. It aims to build a decentralized content-sharing community platform, on which people can obtain the most objective, professional, latest and insightful information in the industry.</div>
      <div class="text">In the times when blockchain is at the golden turning point, 32 Know presents itself as a community that aggregates professional information about blockchain. Cryptocurrency will be provided to everyone who contributes to the community platform. We believe with incentives, users can be motivated to create more premium content to enrich 32 Know. On this platform, we appreciate each user’s value, and welcome them to co-build a healthy community.</div>
      <div class="text">In China, 32 Know is the first blockchain-related information sharing platform that
        offers incentives to every user who contributes to the community. </div>
      <div class="firstTitle">1. Background </div>
      <div class="secondTitle">1.1 Blockchain </div>
      <div class="text">Ever since the birth of blockchain, people are attracted by its usage as a decentralized, traceable, undistorted and transparent database. Especially in the end of 2017, blockchain became a heated topic. An international marketing firm named Research and Markets predicts that in 2020, approximately 65% enterprises will apply blockchain technology. And in 2022, the value of the blockchain global market will reach 13.9 billion U.S dollars. </div>
      <div class="text">In China, blockchain nowadays is more often referred to as a technology instead of a cryptocurrency. From start-up companies to IT giants such as Tencent and Alibaba, they all try to develop and apply blockchain to their business practices. According to the China’s Blockchain Industry White Paper 2018 recently released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People’s Republic of China, by the end of March 2018, there are 456 companies whose main business are blockchain-based. Blockchain technology is widely-used in other industries such as finance, medical, retailing, supply chain, energy sources and media. It is predicted that more and more enterprises and start-ups will embrace blockchain in the future. </div>
      <div class="text">Nevertheless, blockchain is still in its early stage. There’re more details that demand further research. It is too early to say it has already successfully embedded in people’s surroundings. People may not be able to form a comprehensive idea of this technology due to the lack of practical application in real-life situation. Sometimes this situation may lead to misunderstandings, regarding blockchain as a Ponzi scheme, which may aggravates the environment for it to grow. Meanwhile, facing numerous blockchain projects, investors rely more upon Key Opinion Leaders’ recommendations rather than the project’s potential value. In some cases, such projects may be nothing but business schemes, leaving those valuable ones unknown and finally, aborted. To some degree, these phenomenon dismay the blockchain’s development. </div>
      <div class="secondTitle">1.2 The Value of Social Media </div>
      <div class="text">The birth of social media effectively lowers the trust cost for making social contact. Through social media, people can create content, obtain information and present themselves to a wider group of audience. In the past few years, premium UGC (User Generated Content) have already created hundreds of million dollars for social media platforms such as Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc. It is believed that premium content can enrich the platform itself and enhance the content ecosystem. In 2014, Reddit assumed that their platform would be greatly improved if a share of Reddit was offered to every user who posts, makes comments and votes. </div>
      <div class="text">However, it is often the case that only those KOLs, who occupy the most volume, can make profits via different methods (advertising, etc.), while more audience simply generate content without getting any return. In a long run, their motivation will be damped, leading low cohesion within the community. Besides, in order to do advertisement on social media, both authors and brand owners need to give expensive fees to the platform for its own maintenance. The platform’s unclear pricing policy may hurt users’ desire to create. Last but not least, due to the fragmented information and the dispersed yet huge user base on social media, author’s copyright often is not well protected. These can all damage the health of a social media platform. </div>
      <div class="secondTitle">1.3 What Hurts Social Media Users Most? </div>
      <div class="text">Blockchain technology is an inexorable trend, and it is also a fact that social media will continuously affect us. Under this circumstance, our audience are facing the following problems: </div>
      <div class="text">a. Lack of community platforms where people can find and share information about blockchain; </div>
      <div class="text">b. Premium blockchain projects with no KOL’s support may be aborted; </div>
      <div class="text">c. Platform may charge authors of high maintenance fee; </div>
      <div class="text">d. Infringement upon authors’ copyrights are prevalent; </div>
      <div class="text">e. Unclear tax policy for authors on social media; </div>
      <div class="text">f. Advertisements consume users’ attention freely; </div>
      <div class="text">g. Premium content from ordinary users may be ignored. </div>
      <div class="secondTitle">1.4 32 Know’s Solutions </div>
      <div class="text">To solve such problems, 32 Know aims to build a social media community that focuses on spreading blockchain-related information, providing a platform where people can learn about blockchain and also exchange their opinions about this technology. </div>
      <div class="text">By rewarding users with our token, it is expected to stimulate people’s enthusiasm to create more premium content, contribute to the community and facilitate our development. Blockchain technology will also be applied to protect each author and user’s rights. </div>
      <div class="firstTitle">2. Product </div>
      <div class="secondTitle">2.1 What is 32 Know? </div>
      <div class="text">32 Know is a blockchain-based content-sharing platform which provides contributing users with token incentives. </div>
      <div class="secondTitle">2.2 Design Philosophy </div>
      <div class="text">32 Know will share its revenue with every contributing user on our platform. Every contributing role has the right to receive rewards in forms of payment or token. Though it is difficult to quantify users’ efforts behind generating content, we believe their time and effort should by no means be ignored. They all should be well rewarded. </div>
      <div class="text">On 32 Know, an algorithm is designed to rate user’s contribution. This algorithm can guarantee a fair and clear rating system where members can receive incentives accordingly. This system can also detect and defend those who try to gain our tokens by malicious manipulation such as trolling in our community. </div>
      <div class="text">Besides authors, we will award readers as well since they also take up a majority of our user base. By giving our tokens, readers can choose to vote or invest in the content. According to an article’s votes, PVs, investment and sharing, reward will be determined and allocated correspondingly. </div>
      <div class="text">Moreover, advertisers nowadays understand the power or WOM (Word of Mouth) on social media platform. Consequently, they may align with KOLs to launch advertisements. Despite the fact that author can receive returns, a larger part of it goes to the middleman and the platform. From reader’s perspective, the ad, to some degree, may undermine the content and impair their experience. Lastly, it is unreasonable that most advertisers consume readers’ time for free. They don’t need to pay readers for their attention. </div>
      <div class="text">On 32 Know, with cryptocurrency, authors can do business with advertisers directly. The paying process can be simplified. Ordinary users can gain their returns by investing potential content. Advertisers, through paying viewers with token, can compensate their time. It can also assure the advertisement can be effectively received. </div>
      <div class="firstTitle">3. Product Elements </div>

      <div class="firstTitle">5. Token</div>

      <div class="text">32 Know will be inserted to Decent’s blockchain network Dcore. With Decent, we hope to build an open content platform that can creates value. Supporting by Decent’s team, 32 Know will launch our tokens – Zhili based on Decent’s cryptocurrency DCT. Zhili will pair up with DCT and can be exchanged on markets. Considering DCT is currently on various exchange platforms, we expect Zhili’s influence will be enhanced.</div>
      <div class="text">The native cryptographic token Zhili will be used on 32 Know platform. Users’ earnings on the platform will be settled in Zhili. Zhili is mainly used in the following situations:</div>
      <div class="text">a. to invest in contents;</div>
      <div class="text">b. to motivate content authors;</div>
      <div class="text">c. to motivate content spreaders;</div>

      <div class="secondTitle">5.2 The Value of Zhili</div>
      <div class="text">Zhili will be the only token in circulation on our platform. As more users are attracted to our community and the economic ecosystem of the whole platform thrives, the value of Zhili is expected to augment.</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">5.3 Application</div>
      <div class="text">Zhili can be used in the following situations:</div>
      <div class="text">Advertising: Product owners must have Zhili to launch advertisements on 32 Know platform. Zhili is the only circulating token on our platform. The price will be adjusted according to the form of advertisement (article, video, H5, poster, etc.). Moreover, the demonstrating places (opening page, homepage banner, searching column, tag, etc.) for advertisements can also affect the price.</div>
      <div class="text">Solicit Contribution: Product owners can purchase tag and name it after their product on 32 Know with our tokens. Authors who write articles under this tag will be rewarded with extra Zhili. Readers can also be rewarded. In this way, we believe the quality of article can be improved and the advertisement can be effectively exposed to more target audience</div>
      <div class="text">Investment: All our users can invest in valuable contents they are interested and get investment returns after 7 days.</div>
      <div class="text">Withdraw and trade: In the future, Zhili will be launched on cryptocurrency trading platforms. Zhili holders can exchange our tokens with other cryptocurrency. Further, due to the rule that advertisements must be purchased with Zhili, in order to advertise on 32 Know, product owners can buy Zhili on the market or from our users.</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">5.4 Distribution Plan</div>
      <div class="text">10 billion Zhili will be distributed this time at the issue price of 0.02 RMB each, with the overall value of 200 million RMB. These tokens will be issued annually for four years. In the first year, 1 billion will be distributed, 2 billion for the second year, 3 billion for the third year and 4 billion for the fourth year. After issuing all tokens, 32 Know will recollect Zhili in the market and reuse for incentives. The allocation proportion can be seen in the following pie chart.</div>
      <div class="image">
        <img class="imageCircle" src="../assets/images/img_book_en.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="secondTitle">5.5 Recycle Plan</div>
      <div class="text">In order to maintain a sustainable and healthy economic system on our platform and to stabilize the price of our tokens, we will recollect Zhili proportionally. In the early stage, the proportion will be 50%, the recycled tokens will be used for team operation and the platform development. Tokens will be recycled from the following situations:</div>
      <div class="text">Advertising: product owners will have to pay in Zhili for advertising on 32 Know. These tokens will be allocated in our token pool, a part of which will be recycled by the platform, and the rest will be returned to advertisement viewers accordingly based on their viewing time.</div>
      <div class="text">Investment: when users invest in contents, the invested tokens will be allocated in the pool. After returning to authors and investors, the platform will recycle a proportion of tokens for team and platform maintenance.</div>
      <div class="text">Withdraw: in the future, our users can withdraw tokens and trade on the markets. According to the amount of withdrawal tokens, service charge will be needed and paid in Zhili.</div>
      <div class="firstTitle">6. Incentives Mechanism</div>
      <div class="text">The settlement period will be set every seven days since the content is posted with the purpose of ensuring the content’s spreading coverage and our users’ timely rewards. Seven days after the content is published on the platform, based on the votes, PVs, investment and forwarding number, returns will be given. Each author can get the overall return which consists of Minimum Guarantee and Added Value.</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">6.1 Minimum Guarantee</div>
      <div class="text">Minimum Guarantee is a fixed parameter. In other words, once the content is audited and posted on the platform, authors can get the Minimum Guarantee token on the settlement day.</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">6.2 Added Value</div>
      <div class="text">Added Value is affected by the following parameters, such as Click, Share, Investment and Vote. These parameters will be converted to different Weight. The overall Weight determines the Added Value.</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">6.3 Weight</div>
      <div class="text">Weight is used to decide each content’s ranking among others during the settlement period. The parameters will be converted to Weight according to the Weight Factor.</div>
      <div class="text">The formula to evaluate the Weight of a content’s Click is CLICK*CLICK_WEIGHT_FACTOR. For example, if a content received 1000 clicks, and the Weight Factor is 0.1, the Weight of this content’s click is 100. Each parameter corresponds to different Weight Factor.</div>
      <div class="text">In the first stage, the Weight Factor is designed as follows:</div>
      <div class="text">CLICK_WEIGHT_FACTOR=0.1;</div>
      <div class="text">SHARE_WEIGHT_FACTOR=10;</div>
      <div class="text">INVESTMENT_WEIGHT_FACTOR=20</div>
      <div class="text">The formula for calculating Vote’s Weight differentiates from other parameters.</div>
      <div class="text">The formula is:</div>
      <div class="image">
        <img class="imageOperator"  src="../assets/images/operator.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="text">Therefore, on settlement day, the overall Weight of a content is:</div>
      <div class="text">WEIGHT=CLICK*CLICK_WEIGHT_FACTOR+SHARE*SHARE_WEIGHT_FACTOR+INVESTMENT*INVESTMENT_WEIGHT_FACTOR+VOTE_WEIGHT</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">6.4 Ranking</div>
      <div class="text">The overall Weight of a content decides the content’s ranking. The more Weight, the higher place the content ranks.</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">6.5 Added Value</div>
      <div class="text">According to the ranking, tokens will be allocated based on the following chart:</div>
      <div class="image">
        <img class="imageList"  src="../assets/images/img_image.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="text">Once tokens are given to each content, referring to the investment proportion,investors will be offered a certain amount of tokens in return.</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">6.6 Community Incentives</div>
      <div class="text">For users who prefer not to generate content, besides investment, they can also earn their tokens from daily sign-in, reporting inappropriate content, forwarding and inviting others to join our community. For example, each sign-in generate 1 Zhili, and the number of rewarding Zhili will increase if users sign in consecutively; a valid content report will generate 3 Zhili; each forwarding 2 Zhili; a valid inviting (the invited registered on our platform) 20 Zhili. 20% of our tokens will be used in this part.</div>
      <div class="secondTitle">6.7 Others</div>
      <div class="text">The project team, investor and our partners can purchase Zhili via other cryptocurrency for advertising or other cooperation. The community will reserve 15% Zhili for future development and platform management.</div>
